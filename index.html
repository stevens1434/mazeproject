	 			<h2>TECHNOLOGIES USED</h2>
				<p>Took advantage of JavaScript and jQuery for all of the logic for the game. Those were used to manipulate the CSS and HTML files.</p> <br> <br>
				<h2>APPROACH</h2>
				<p>The approach was simple. Build a map using a JavaScript array and allow two players to move around that array. First, I built the HTML file. After that I created the map logic and the ability to move around the map. After setting up the logic for forcing the players to say on the path, or to hit a win condition I was able to add some more “fun” features, like jumping players (and forcing them to stop moving for five seconds) and the bombs.</p><br> <br>

				<h2>UNSOLVED PROBLEMS & FUTURE UPDATES</h2>
				<p>There may be a way to refactor some of the code. I would also like to give the players a laser gun.</p>
