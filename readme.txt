technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
Took advantage of JavaScript and jQuery for all of the logic for the game. Those were used to manipulate the CSS and HTML files.


APPROACH
The approach was simple. Build a map using a JavaScript array and allow two players to move around that array. First, I built the HTML file. After that I created the map logic and the ability to move around the map. After setting up the logic for forcing the players to say on the path, or to hit a win condition I was able to add some more “fun” features, like jumping players (and forcing them to stop moving for five seconds) and the bombs.

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS & FUTURE UPDATES
There may be a way to refactor some of the code. I would also like to give the players a laser gun.
